  "description": "This mod is a collaboration between Mad Agus and ohyeah2389. Mad Agus made the 3D model of the car, while ohyeah2389 made the physics and sound of the car.\n\nThe Hangul is a WRL-homologated T-180 racing vehicle designed by Togokhan Motors to compete in the WRL championship racing series. The Togokhan-designed TM 9-71 hotblock uses triple-annealed impulse-reaction blades and Anisotropic-Damascus cylinder liners to reliably produce 420psi of average chamber pressure. This power is managed through deployment of Togokhan's proprietary stern-mounted 'Thermionic Recipricator' switched torque-distribution networking hardware.",
