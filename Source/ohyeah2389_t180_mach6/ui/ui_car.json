  "description": "The Mach 6 is a WRL-homologated T-180 racing vehicle designed by Pops Racer and built by the Racer family to compete in the WRL championship racing series. It is outfitted with a Bernoulli convergenator for direct rearward thrust as well as pressure application to a V8 engine routed through a manually shifted mechanical drivetrain for combined, easy-to-operate thrust and torque instead of the state-of-the-art generator-transponder-thruster setup.",
