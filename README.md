Release builds are also available at [overtake.gg](https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/t-180-platform.75150/).

## Introduction
The Assetto T-180 is a modular vehicle platform designed to replicate, and to the furthest extent reasonable, simulate the T-180 racing vehicles from the 2008 Speed Racer movie. The cars using this platform are intended for use in the vehicle simulation game Assetto Corsa with Custom Shaders Patch's physics extensions, which they rely on to a high level.

## Installation
The vehicles are installed to Assetto Corsa by extracting their folders contained within the downloaded zip file (available on the Releases page) to your Assetto Corsa install directory under "assettocorsa/content/cars". Installation using third-party tools or launchers may not work reliably, especially upon updating the car.

## Controls
The car makes use of special bindings for its different features. To bind these controls, load the car in-game and open the Extended Controls app. To bind a control, navigate to it in Extended Controls, click on the binding button, and press the keyboard, wheel, or gamepad button you want to bind to it. 
For cars that are equipped with a turbojet engine, it is recommended to bind at least the "Turbine Throttle Override" control. This control is used often both during turns (for extra cornering force under high drift angles) and on straights (for extra acceleration). Other controls are explained in the Systems section below.
This car is designed for use with a wheel, but you can use it with a gamepad/controller or a keyboard:
- Set the Rotation Range option in the FFB Tuning section of the car's setup menu in-game to **180** if using a controller.
- If using a keyboard, you might find that turning this same setting to **45** makes the car turn more.
- You shouldn't use an assisted gamepad script (like Advanced Gamepad Assist) with this car, as it will not know how to steer the wheels of the car very well, if at all.
